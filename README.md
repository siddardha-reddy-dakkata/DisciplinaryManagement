# DisciplinaryManagement
This project tracks and stores disciplinary activities of students in the college. We used Java, JDBC, AWT, and Swing components to implement a user-friendly interface, allowing the user or admin to perform CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on records. Additionally, the user can view the records, which are structured with a menuBar.
